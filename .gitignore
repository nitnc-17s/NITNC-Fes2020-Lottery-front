# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/app/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/app/tmp/.keep

# secret file
secrets.env
/conf/*.conf

# vim temp file
*.swp
# .DS_Store
.DS_Store
